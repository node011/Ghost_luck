**README for the Shellcode Loader Code {fully generated by AI}**

**Overview**

This code is a shellcode loader that unloads the NTDLL library via indirect syscalls and loads a shellcode from a file named `shellcode.bin`. The shellcode is executed after loading.

**Features**

- Unloads NTDLL library via indirect syscalls
- Loads shellcode from a file named `shellcode.bin`
- Executes the loaded shellcode

**Usage**

1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. The shellcode will be loaded and executed.

**Note**

- The shellcode should be in a file named `shellcode.bin` in the same directory as the executable.
- The shellcode should be a binary file containing the shellcode.
- The shellcode should be designed to be executed in the context of the current process.

**Limitations**

- This code is designed for Windows systems only.
- The shellcode should be designed to be executed in the context of the current process.
- The shellcode should be a binary file containing the shellcode.

**License**
